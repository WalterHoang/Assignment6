			<h2>About this app</h2>
			<p>This app is a basic calculator app that has full keyboard control support using a 5 key and a 3 key setup.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The 5-key setup uses wasd to move the cursor up, left, down, and right respectively and the e key to select the item that the cursor has highlighted</li>
				<li>The 3-key setup uses u to move left, o to move right, and i to select the button highlighted.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To evaluate the better setup of the two, I will compare the time it takes to complete 5 equations as well as comparing the amount of errors made to complete them using my left hand only. Each setup will have 3 trials and the average time and error count of each setup will be compared </p>
			<ul>
				<li>The equations used are: 36+73*21, (192/455)+316, (700-406)/13, (12*82)+3, and 16-5*2+12*23 </li>
			</ul>
			<p>Test results</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The 5-key setup had an average time of 1 minute and 35 seconds and an average error count of 2.3 </li>
				<li>The 3-key setup had an average time of 1 minute and 40 seconds and an average error count of 0.6 </li>
				<li>Thus we can conclude that the 3-key setup has a much better average performance for a user with no disabilities assuming they use their hand most comfortable to them. In this case I was most comfortable with my left hand on the left side of my keyboard. </li>
				<li>Possible reasons: I had alternated between the 5-key and 3-key setup but have gotten used to the controls so that my times were reduced. Also, the equations were not changed inbetween trials so i eventually paid more attention to where the cursor was as the trials went on. However, I was more prone to moving the cursor elsewhere in the 5-key setup where as I didn't make that many errors but had to take longer to select the right key in the 3-key setup.</li>
